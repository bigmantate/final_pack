# Linux 3 Final Pack

Going into this class I was exited to learn more about linux and hopefully get more fluent with the command line. I have always admired and have been extremely interested in the open source philosophy. Throughout the semester my scripting improved more than I had expected. I am nowhere near as comfortable as I would like to be with my knowledge and efficiency with scripting but have a solid base to proceed. Though it would be slow I feel I have the capability to use the shell as a tool much outside resources. With just the terminal and of course the man pages and tools such as info and help, the design of this operating system is meant to be useful and used. The power that this free tool has is limitless and available to all. 

## Class Highlights

One of the great parts of this class was the creativity allowed to use the technology we are studying. Not redundant study guides or majority reading about theory, in our class we were hands on. Creating our own operating system that could fit into our pocket and the ability and knowledge to make many more was just the start. I created a usb operating system with Tails to start. I had some issues with keeping persistence running and saving between use. I decided to go another path and created a usb with Arch Linux. It was very hands on and I appreciate the work to set it up now. The installation was done through the command line and only in the final steps was a GUI added.

## Group Project

Our group project was an interesting road. In the beginning we were going to create a File Server, and then an interesting group project presented itself. We became Oops Slackers, who were tasked to reinstall the Windows 7 operating system on a few units in the classroom that were down. We were tasked to use iPXE to clone from a central server, operating systems amongst other programs. This is the future as with many other things, centralized, and less hardware. It was a great experience. In our group Pavel and Lucas took the lead and deserve the majority of the credit. They both put in countless hours and went above and beyond up until implementation of our presentation. I wish I could have played a larger role in the breakthroughs that they came up with but I am happy I was part of the team. I participated in every group chat and personal group meeting we had. Following along throughout the entirety of the project. I was a support, documenting where I could and attempting steps we thought necessary at the time. Overall I made myself available to the group and took the opportunity to learn through each step.

## Attendance

I was present at each time class was held.

## Conclusion

Include are folders of the weeks scripts, papers, and group summaries. Most are organized together according to the week. The Oops project folder has the first few summaries and the rest can be found within the corresponding week folders. I have gone to college before in another field and towards the end of that experience became a little burnt out and lost some of the initial passion with studying theory. The way this course was conducted brought out the hands on and mind opening of why many of us choose this field in the first place. It is important to keep students “eyes on the prize” as that is where this course succeeded in my opinion. I hope this college and others realize the importance of why its valuable to get out of the book at times and learn through experience of trial and error. This is just the beginning.
